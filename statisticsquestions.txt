
What type of sampling is this: Every member of the population is equally likely to be chosen. (type your answer in lower case, and in form: "x sampling").
simple random sampling
What type of sampling is this: Find sample sise of n from a population of size N, taking one member from the first k memebers of the population at random (type your answer in lower case, and in form: "x sampling").
systematic sampling
What type of sampling is this: Splitting a population into distinct groups then sampling within each group. (type your answer in lower case, and in form: "x sampling").
stratified sampling
What type of sampling is this: Take samples from members of the population you have access to until you have a sample of the desired size. (type your answer in lower case, and in form: "x sampling").
opportunity sampling
What type of sampling is this: You know you want distinct groups to be represented in the sample, decide how many of each group you wish to sample in advance and use oppurtunity sampling til the sample is large enough for each group. (type your answer in lower case, and in form: "x sampling").
quote sampling
What type of sampling is this: Split the population into clusters that you expect to be similar to each other, then take a sample from each of these clusters. (type your answer in lower case, and in form: "x sampling").
